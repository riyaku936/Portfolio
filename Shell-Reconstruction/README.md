## Project Information

The aim of this Java based project was to develop a shell similar to the terminal available on computers. To parse in the inputted command the ANTLR library was utilised. We then produced a valid output for the inputted user command with the help of the Visitor, Decorator and Singleton design patterns. By the end, our shell  passed 90.77% of acceptance tests (provided by professor) and supported complex commands such as the pipe operator, command substitution, and regular expressions.
