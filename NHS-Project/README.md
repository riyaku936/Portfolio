## Project Information

The goal of this C# based project was to develop a search system for medical policies in the NHS. An interactive chatbot was designed for the user interface of the search system using the Azure Bot Framework and LUIS. Additionally to make the search system faster for a large database of documents Azure Databricks was utilised. In the end it was found that for 88% of client queries the system returned the relevant policy in the top 5 results.
