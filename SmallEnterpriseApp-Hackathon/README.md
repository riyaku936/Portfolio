## Project Information

The goal of this Java project is to develop a mobile application that recommends small businesses for customers to visit so they can complete their dayâ€™s tasks and simultaneously support struggling enterprises. To determine the best route for the user the Google Maps API was used. Once the itinerary for the day was determined the user can explore reviews of places (developed via the Yelp API) and add their experiences of visiting the small businesses to their collection of memories.
